/**
 * <p>
 * You have been hired to support the Discord audio chat system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The system relies on user's microphone data coming into a shared system for playback to all participants (and
 * possibly recording!).  But they need a CS expert to handle input from the microphones and ensure that all the audio
 * is correctly interleaved into understandable output.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Your job is to collect raw data streams (audio tones) from microphones and save them into an organized data stream in 
 * a virtualized audio concentrator. This task is not trivial - if data from one microphone is included in the feed
 * from another microphone, the audio recording will be unusable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Microphone and Player class have been provided for you by the microphone manufacturer. You will not need to
 * customize them.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <strong>Player</strong> class is simply a player of audio data. If you are successful at keeping the audio
 * data in order, the data will play as tones.</li>
 * <li>The <strong>Microphone</strong> class takes the analog data coming from the microphone and sends it in digital
 * (16-bit wav) format to the audio concentrator.</li>
 * <li>You must complete the <strong>AudioConcentrator</strong> class. An audio concentrator is a device that accepts
 * multiple audio inputs. The audio chat system has a microphone for each of the six participants: partA, partB, partC, 
 * partD, partE, and partF. The Audio concentrator must accept an input from each of these participants' microphone. The
 * microphones have a limited amount of memory, so you must periodically copy each sampled audio to the AudioConcentrator 
 * data structure. The AudioConcentrator class maintains a Queue data structure to store all the data, accepting samples
 * from each microphone and adding them to the queue of data. Once a sampling sequence is complete, the Player will play 
 * the audio files and display the audiowave before saving the recording. If the data are in the correct sequence, tones
 * will be played of a length equal to the total audio time. For example, six microphones recording one second of audio 
 * data should play back six seconds of data. If the data for samples are not being recorded in order, you will hear
 * static. If the samples are not being saved to the shared data structure Queue, the recording will be too short. 
 * You should hear one tone for each sample taken by each microphone. e.g., 6 microphones and 2 samples = 12 tones. 
 * (no static)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The main method has been supplied for you.
